🌀 Fingerprint Recognition using MLP + Tkinter GUI
This project is a Fingerprint Recognition System built with:

🧠 MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) for classification.

🖼️ Tkinter GUI for an interactive user interface.

🛠️ Augmented data with rotation to improve robustness.

🚀 Features
✅ Train a fingerprint dataset with:

Auto data augmentation (rotate each image from 10° to 180°).

Dropout to prevent overfitting.

Batch training with progress bar and Loss/Accuracy chart.

✅ Recognize fingerprints:

Select any .BMP image.

View the prediction and the Top 3 classes with highest confidence.

Real-time image processing: blur & rotate the input fingerprint.
